**(Sound of a short, thoughtful musical sting - maybe a single piano chord or a breathy synth pad)**

Alright, folks, switching gears now to a story that’s been simmering in the background and continues to be a difficult and complex situation. You know we always try to keep it real here, so let's dive into this.

We've got news today focusing on the perspective of Dave McKean. Yeah, *that* Dave McKean - the visionary artist who collaborated with Neil Gaiman on so many iconic projects like "Sandman" and "Mirrormask." He's now speaking out, giving his personal account of how he experienced the recent sexual assault allegations leveled against Neil Gaiman.

The headline: **Dave McKean on how he experienced the sexual assault allegations against Neil Gaiman - HQ.**

Now, these allegations, as you know, are still very much ongoing. While we've heard some initial reports, there's been no final judgment made. It's been a while since the initial news broke, and things are still developing. We're going to delve into what McKean has to say about this incredibly sensitive situation and his personal journey navigating it.

Because next up, we're going back to the early 90s, back to a time of flannel shirts, Doc Martens, and a whole lotta mosh pits. This is a song that, I swear, the second those opening chords hit, you just *know* what's coming. A song that practically defined a generation, a song that's still just as electrifying today as it was back then.

So crank it up, people! Get ready to jump around in your living room, your car, your office cubicle (just don't get fired!), because coming up next, we've got the one, the only, the immortal... Nirvana! And this is "Smells Like Teen Spirit"! Let's GO!

Coming to us straight from the HQ, we're hearing rumblings of potential progress in the ongoing US-China trade situation. Get this: the US and China are reportedly heading to Geneva to open trade talks this Saturday!

That's right, high-level discussions, face-to-face. Now, we all know there's been some serious tariff pressure on both sides, so this meeting is a pretty big deal. Will they find common ground? Will those tariffs start to ease up? We'll be keeping a close eye on these developments in Geneva and bringing you the latest updates as we get them. This could be a turning point, folks, so stay tuned! More after the break!

Now, Billie's been keeping us on our toes lately with her latest album, and this next track? Oh honey, this one is stuck in my head like glitter in a carpet! It's got that signature Billie sound - you know, that dreamy, ethereal vibe with a little bit of an edge - but this time, she's giving us a taste of pure, unadulterated *love*! Well, maybe not *unadulterated*, it's Billie after all, so expect a twist!

Alright music lovers, buckle up, buttercups, because we're about to dive into a track that's as iconic as it is… well, let’s just say it's got a certain *vibe*. We've all been there, right? That feeling of being, shall we say, a little bit... *outside* the norm? 

Well, get ready to embrace your inner oddball, because next up we're spinning a tune that perfectly captures that feeling of being just a little bit… different.

Give it up for the band that redefined alt-rock and gave us a song we still scream along to, even though we might secretly cringe a little inside! 

Coming up next, it’s Radiohead with… "Creep"! Hit it!

Alright folks, buckle up because things have been kicking off in the world of Formula 1! We're hearing absolutely wild news coming out of the Alpine camp, that's the English-French squad, formerly Renault, remember? Hold onto your hats because… Franco Colapinto, yep, you heard right, Franco Colapinto is benefitting from what's been a truly *tumultuous* night at Alpine HQ! And why is that? Well, get this... Oliver Oakes has stepped down as Team Principal in a *surprise* resignation. We'll be digging into the details of what's going on behind the scenes, but for now, it looks like this shakeup is set to potentially have a real impact on Colapinto's prospects. Stay tuned, we'll be right back with more on this developing story after the break!

Alright music lovers, you've been waiting patiently, and I appreciate that! We just had a little bit of the oldies, now it's time for something a little bit...dreamy. You know those songs that just wash over you like a warm summer breeze? Well, buckle up buttercups, because that's exactly what we're about to dive into.

This next track is from a band that consistently brings the vibes. They're masters of creating this hazy, hypnotic atmosphere with their music. Seriously, I swear they sprinkle some kind of magic dust into every single song! 

So, grab your headphones, maybe a comfy blanket, and get ready to float away with this next one. It's a gem from The Marías, and it's called "No One Noticed." Let's give it a spin!

Alright alright alright, everybody feeling good out there tonight? I hope so, 'cause we're about to dive into a grunge classic that's still as relevant as ever! This next tune is a total anthem for just being yourself, flaws and all. And let's be honest, who *doesn't* have a few quirks? I know I do! (Don't ask about my sock collection... just trust me). 

Anyway, enough about my questionable fashion choices. Get ready to crank it up and embrace your inner awkwardness, 'cause next up we're gonna spin a track from the band that defined a generation. Get ready to come as you are, as you were, as I want you to be! This is Nirvana with "Come As You Are"! Let's go!

Alright, alright, alright! What's shakin' bacon, listeners? You're tuned into [Your Radio Station Name] and your boy/girl, [Your Name], is here to bring the heat!

Now, we've been vibing to some serious bangers today, and I'm feeling the energy! But you know what? We need to elevate, we need to transcend, we need... a little lyrical mastery.

And who better to deliver that than the one and only, Pulitzer Prize winner himself, the Compton king, KENDRICK LAMAR! 

But wait, there's more! (And I'm not selling vacuum cleaners, I promise!) Joining K-Dot on this track is the queen of ethereal vocals, the voice that makes you wanna melt into a puddle of good vibes... the phenomenal SZA!

So get ready to turn up the volume, clear your mind, and let these two legends take you on a journey. We're about to drop a dose of pure audio brilliance on you.

Get ready for it... this is Kendrick Lamar, with the incredible SZA, and this is "luther"! Let's GO!

Alright folks, let's keep this good mood rollin' with a band that needs no introduction, but I'm gonna give 'em one anyway! They've bent our minds, moved our souls, and redefined what it means to be... well, them! 

Up next, we're diving into a track that's equal parts beautiful, haunting, and just plain weird. You know, the Radiohead trifecta! Get ready to ponder the meaning of life, and maybe question your recent internet search history, because here it comes... Radiohead with "Karma Police"! Let's get lost in it!

Alright music lovers, buckle up, because it's about to get a whole lot sweeter in here! You know that feeling when you're just effortlessly fabulous? Like, you're the sugar rush in everyone's day? Well, get ready to embrace that vibe because coming up next we've got a certified bop that's going to have you dancing in your car, at your desk, wherever you are! This track is all about that "it girl" energy, that "je ne sais quoi" that just makes everyone go wild. So, ditch the blah and get ready for a shot of pure energy! Hit it! This is Sabrina Carpenter and "Espresso"!

Alright, folks, coming up next we're gonna slow things down just a touch. You know, sometimes you need a little breather, a little moment of zen in your day, right? Well, I've got just the sonic tonic for you!

This one's a classic, a timeless tune from a band that never fails to deliver. It's got that dreamy, ethereal vibe that's perfect for staring out the window or just… you know… contemplating the mysteries of the universe. Or maybe just contemplating what you're gonna have for dinner. Either way, this is the perfect soundtrack!

So, sit back, relax, and let the gentle waves of sound wash over you. Get ready for a little slice of melancholic beauty from the one and only Radiohead! Here it is, "No Surprises!"
