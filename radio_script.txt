There's a lot to unpack here. This interview with Dave McKean is sure to offer some important perspective on how he's processed everything. We're talking about deeply personal stuff and the impact these allegations are having. It's important to remember this has a real impact on real people.

But the whispers are that Brentford might be asking for a pretty penny! A price tag that could potentially give Newcastle some second thoughts. Ooh, the drama!
