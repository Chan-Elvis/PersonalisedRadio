[00:00] **(Upbeat, cheerful intro music fades)**

Alright, Lovely Day listeners, Jerry here, ready to brighten your morning! And speaking of bright… we've got a headline that's absolutely *legendary*.

**(Slight pause, a little dramatic flair)**

You guys remember… internet history? Well, buckle up, buttercups, because we're talking about **LEEEEROOOY JENKINS!**

**(Sound of a single, dramatic "DUN-DUN!")**

That’s right! The legendary Leeroy Jenkins clip, the one that’s been quoted, parodied, and memed across the globe, is celebrating its… drumroll please… **20th ANNIVERSARY!**

**(Short pause, allowing for the listener to absorb the news)**

Can you believe it? Twenty years since that fateful day in World of Warcraft when a certain… *enthusiastic*… player, well, let’s just say he didn’t exactly stick to the plan! "LEEEEROOOY JENKINS!" - a battle cry that still echoes through the halls of the internet, a testament to epic fails and the unpredictable joy of online gaming. It was all the way back on May 11th, 2005, when the guild "Pals for Lif..."  (we’ll get into the full story later in the show, don’t you worry!), unleashed this cultural phenomenon upon the world.

**(Slight chuckle)**

So, happy anniversary, Leeroy! You've given us all a lot to laugh about over the past two decades. And who knows, maybe we’ll all yell "LEEEEROOOY JENKINS!" together later today, just for old time's sake!

**(Upbeat jingle plays, transitioning to the next segment)**

Here it is:

**News: [similar_liked] Students and the science of feedback - Feedback for students should be constructive, positive, and timely to augment the interlinked, symbiotic relationship between learning and teaching.**

Feedback f... (pause, letting the listener ponder)

That's right, folks! We're talking about the vital, the crucial, the absolutely *essential* power of feedback, and how it shapes the whole shebang of learning. It's about giving our students the kind of information, the kind of encouragement, that helps them flourish, that helps them grow, that helps them truly *learn*. Think about it – when you get helpful advice, when you get that little nudge in the right direction, doesn’t it make you feel, well, *better*? More motivated? More... capable? That’s the magic they’re talking about!

So, next time you're thinking about giving some feedback, remember to keep it constructive, keep it positive, and keep it… *on time*! Because that, my friends, is the key to unlocking a truly lovely day for everyone involved in this incredible dance of learning. And that, my friends, is a recipe for a truly lovely life!

**(Jerry laughs again, a little louder this time)**

It's a reminder, isn't it? To appreciate the little things, to find the joy in the everyday. Look up at the sky, smell the flowers, and hey... if you're feeling extra good, maybe grab yourself a grilled cheese! You deserve it!

See what I mean? Beautiful! It's a reminder, isn't it, that in the face of… well, you know, the things we all worry about these days… the best medicine can often be found right outside your door. Whether it's a towering oak in the park, the tiny leaves of a sprout, or the sheer, majestic presence of a forest – nature is calling!

So, take a moment, folks. Take a deep breath. Maybe, just maybe, take a walk and see what wonders you can find. Because sometimes, just reconnecting with the beauty around us is exactly what we need. And we'll bring you more on this story as it develops, here on Lovely Day Station!

[53:08] Alright, sunshine and smiles, it's your main man Jerry here, keeping the vibes smooth on Lovely Day Station! Time for a little peek behind the curtain... or should I say, the *casino* curtain, eh?

And the news is... (drumroll please, folks!) from the bright lights of Las Vegas, we're talking about the world of gaming! Now, Golden Entertainment, a big player in the Vegas scene, just announced a new partnership. Sounds exciting, right? 

But, and here's the kicker, the news also mentions some *year-over-year declines*. Seems like things weren't quite as golden as they could be, mostly thanks to something missing... and that thing is... (you guessed it!) the Super... (I can't say it, it's too obvious!). 

So, there you have it! A bit of a mixed bag from the gaming world. New partnerships are always fun to hear about, but we'll be watching closely to see how Golden Entertainment bounces back! Stay tuned for more updates and more happy tunes on Lovely Day Station! Keep it sunny, everyone!
